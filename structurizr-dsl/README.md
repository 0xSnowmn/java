This GitHub repository contains an implementation of the Structurizr DSL - a way to create Structurizr software
architecture models based upon the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) using a textual domain specific language (DSL).
The Structurizr DSL has appeared on the
[ThoughtWorks Tech Radar - Techniques - Diagrams as code](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/diagrams-as-code)
and is text-based wrapper around the [Structurizr for Java library](https://github.com/structurizr/java).
