Structurizr for Java
====

Structurizr is an implementation of the C4 model as described in Simon Brown's
[Software Architecture for Developers](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers) book, which provides a way to easily and effectively communicate the software architecture of a software system. Structurizr allows you to create __software architecture models and diagrams as code__. This project contains the Java implementation and tooling.

Everything you see here is a work in progress. See [structurizr.com](http://structurizr.com) for more information.
